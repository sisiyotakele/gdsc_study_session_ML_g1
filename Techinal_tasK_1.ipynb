        "\n",
        "Why:\n",
        "\n",
        "We have labeled data: past electricity usage paired with known weather information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to predict a continuous numerical value (future electricity usage), which makes it a regression problem under supervised learning.\n",

        "Data Collection: Gather historical electricity usage, temperature, humidity, and day/time information.\n",

        "Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and remove outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature Selection/Engineering: Create useful features such as average usage of past 7 days or weekend/weekday.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model Selection: Choose models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.\n",
        "\n",
        "Training: Feed the model labeled examples (input + expected output).\n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluation: Test on unseen data using metrics like MAE or RMSE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Deployment: Send predictions to a dashboard or app for users.\n",

        "Monitoring: Continuously check model performance and update it as patterns change.\n",

        "If the dataset does not include enough examples — especially for different seasons or weather conditions — the model will fail to generalize and make poor predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fix:\n",
        "\n",
        "Collect more diverse historical data covering all seasons.\n",
        "\n",
        "Augment data with additional features like appliance-level usage or weather forecasts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model is robust."
