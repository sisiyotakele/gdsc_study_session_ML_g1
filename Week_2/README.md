# Week 2: House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project implements a simple machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features using Linear Regression from scikit-learn.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about houses including:
- price: House price (target variable)
- area: Area in square feet
- bedrooms: Number of bedrooms
- bathrooms: Number of bathrooms
- stories: Number of stories
- mainroad: Proximity to main road
- guestroom: Guest room availability
- basement: Basement availability
- hotwater: Hot water heating
- airconditioning: Air conditioning
- parking: Number of parking spaces
- prefarea: Preferred area
- furnishingstatus: Furnishing status

## Project Structure

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the dataset using pandas
- Explore data structure and statistics
- Check for missing values

### 2. Data Preparation
- Select features and target variable
- Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

### 3. Model Training
- Initialize Linear Regression model
- Train on training data
- Learn relationship between area and price

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Make predictions on test set
- Calculate MSE, MAE, and RMSE
- Compute R-squared score
- Visualize results with plots

### 5. Model Extension
- Implement multiple linear regression with more features
- Compare performance with single-feature model

## Key Results
- Linear relationship between house area and price
- Model performance metrics (MSE, MAE, R-squared)
- Visualizations showing regression line and residuals
